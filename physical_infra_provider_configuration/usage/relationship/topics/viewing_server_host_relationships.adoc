=== Viewing relationships between physical servers and virtual hosts

CloudForms shows relationships between virtual host systems and physical servers and the virtual hosts for each physical-infrastructure provider. The topology view provides a graphical representation of the relationships, allowing you to easily navigate between connected nodes (see the following figure).
