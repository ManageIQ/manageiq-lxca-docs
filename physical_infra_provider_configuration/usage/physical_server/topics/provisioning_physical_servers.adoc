=== Provisioning physical servers using configuration patterns

You can use configuration patterns in XClarity Administrator to quickly provision or preprovision multiple servers from a single set of defined configuration settings. Configuration patterns act as templates for configuring logical storage, I/O adapters, boot order, and other baseboard management controller and Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) settings.

A physical-infrastructure provider can discover configuration patterns that are defined on the associated XClarity Administrator instance. A configuration pattern can then be applied to a single or multiple physical servers.

*Note*: Configuration patterns can be assigned only to physical servers that do not have a pattern assigned to them.
