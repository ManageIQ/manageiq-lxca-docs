=== Creating a user that belongs to the physical infrastructure usergroup

You can use the physical infrastructure usergroup to manage physical infrastructures. Users that belong to this group have a default dashboard that contains physical server widgets. The physical server widgets show useful information, such as server health, availability, and recently discovered servers.

To gain the benefits of this usergroup, you must create a new user that belongs to the physical infrastructure group.

. Follow the steps described in the _Creating a User_ section in the _CloudForms General Configuration_ documentation. For the group, choose _EvmGroup-physical_infrastructure_.

After the user is created, log in as the new user, and the default dashboard containing physical server widgets is displayed.
