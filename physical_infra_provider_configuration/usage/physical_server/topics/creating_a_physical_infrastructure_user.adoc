=== Creating a user belonging to the physical infrastructure usergroup

The physical infrastructure usergroup can be used for managing physical infrastructures. Users belonging to this group have a default dashboard with the physical server widgets displayed that show useful information such as server health, availability, and recently discovered servers.

To gain the benefits of this usergroup, you must create a new user belonging to the physical infrastructure group.

. Follow the steps described in the _Creating a User_ section in the _CloudForms General Configuration_ documentation. For the group, choose _EvmGroup-physical_infrastructure_.

After the user is created, log in as the new user, and the default dashboard containing physical server widgets will be displayed.
