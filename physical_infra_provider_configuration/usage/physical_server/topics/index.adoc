== Managing physical servers

After the Lenovo physical-infrastructure provider is added, the servers that are managed by Lenovo XClarity Administrator are registered in CloudForms. You can then view and manage those servers.

_Note_: It may take a few seconds or so for the servers to appear after adding a physical-infrasturcture provider.
