== Configuring XClarity Administrator

XClarity Administrator virtual appliances are connected to CloudForms by adding physical-infrastructure providers. Physical-infrastructure providers enable you to manage and interact with devices that are managed by XClarity Administrator. After the physical-infrastructure provider is added, the devices that are managed by the XClarity Administrator are registered in CloudForms. Managed devices can be monitored, configured, and updated using XClarity Administrator. The physical-infrastructure provider surfaces information about these managed devices and the XClarity Administrator instance.
