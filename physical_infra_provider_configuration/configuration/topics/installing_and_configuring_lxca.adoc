==== Discovering and Managing Hardware

XClarity Administrator can discover manageable systems that are in your environment by
performing an SLP discovery for systems that are on the same IP subnet as
XClarity Administrator. A specified IP address or range of IP addresses also can be used and
information can be imported from a spreadsheet, a process that is known as a Bulk Import.  Discovery options can be accessed by selecting Hardware -> Discover and Manage New Devices from the menu bar.  Discovered systems can now be managed by XClarity Administrator. During this process you will be asked for login credentials for the management module of the target systems and given the option to create a recovery account for the appliances. Managed systems can be monitored, configured and updated via XClarity and the Lenovo XClarity Provider for CloudForms can surface details via the CloudForms user interface.
