== Updating physical server firmware using ansible playbooks

In CloudForms, physical server firmware can be updated through the use of an ansible playbook.

_Note_: An Ansible Tower provider, pointing to a Ansible Tower instance, must be added to CloudForms. See the _Adding an Ansible Tower Provider_ section in the _CloudForms Managing Providers_ documentation.

. Within Ansible Tower, create a job template for the config.yml playbook. This playbook will allow you to perform a firmware upgrade on a physical server. You can get this playbook from: https://github.com/lenovo/ansible.lenovo-lxca
. Follow the steps described in the _Executing an Ansible Tower Job Template from a Service Catalog_ section in the _CloudForms Managing Providers_ documentation and use the job template created in the previous step (should be discovered by the Ansible Tower provider).
