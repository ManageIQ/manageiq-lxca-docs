== Creating a policy to power on servers that are powered off

In CloudForms, there is a control policy for physical servers that powers a server back on when it is powered off.

To enable this policy, you must assign the physical infrastructure profile to a server.

. Navigate to *Compute > Physical Infrastructure > Servers* to display the Physical Servers page.
. Click a server (to display the Physical Server Summary page) or select multiple servers that you want to provision.
. Click on *Policy > Manage Policies* from the top menu. The Physical Server Policy Assignment page is displayed.
. Select the *Physical Infrastructure Profile* checkbox.
. Click on the *Save* button.

The policy is now assigned to the server.
